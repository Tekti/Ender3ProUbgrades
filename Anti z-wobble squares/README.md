# Anti z-wobble squares

Anti-wobble z Axis nut for Ender 3, Ender 3 pro and similiar
This design should work on any 3D printer where distance between bracket/stepper motor and middle of the screw is greater than 14mm. THe nut helps with Z-wobble effect.

Glueing of the magnets is not necessary. All magnets needs to be inserted so they attract each other.

### Direct drive mount

Description of the files:
-   <i>Square_16mm.stl</i> - used for TR8x2/4/8 nut (16 mm between mounting holes)
-   <i>Square_18mm.stl</i> - used for TR8x8 nut (original from creality, 18mm between mounting holes) and to mount device to the bracket
-   <i>Square_16mm.stl</i> - middle part

Additional parts:
-   M3 8mm screws - 2x
-   6x3mm magnets - 12x (full stabilization), 8x (enough for working)
-   4mm steel balls (I took mine from 628 bearing) - 4x

### Bowden mount

Description of the files:
-   <i>Square_16mm_Bowden_45deg.stl</i> - used for TR8x2/4/8 nut (16 mm between mounting holes)
-   <i>Square_18mm_Bowden_45deg.stl</i> - used for mounting device to the bracket
-   <i>Square_18mm_Bowden_StockNut_45deg.stl</i> - used for mounting TR8x8 nut to the device(original from creality, 18mm between mounting holes)
-   <i>Square_Middle_Bowden_45deg.stl</i> - middle part


Additional parts:
-   M3 8mm screws - 4x
-   4x4mm magnets - 12x (full stabilization), 8x (enough for working)
-   4mm steel balls (I took mine from 628 bearing) - 4x


### Example print configuration for Stock Parts with Bowden configuration
-   <i>Square_18mm_Bowden_45deg.stl</i> - Top part, should be screwed to the bottom of the bracket (steel balls aiming bottom)
-   <i>Square_18mm_Bowden_StockNut_45deg.stl</i> - Bottom Part, screwed together with the original creality z axis nut.
-   <i>Square_Middle_Bowden_45deg.stl</i> - middle part
